## About Me
I'm Ivan, a self-driven data scientist who has embarked on a continuous journey of exploration, learning, and growth. I aim to create impactful solutions in the realms of data science, machine learning, and beyond.

## Background
I'm a self-motivated learner who completed the Yandex Practicum course, which solidified my knowledge base. I've always been fascinated by the world of data and its power to uncover hidden insights. 

## What Drives Me
The Flammarion engraving (the picture above) perfectly shows my never-ending thirst for knowledge. Just like the figure in the engraving, I'm unraveling the hidden mysteries and expanding my modest understanding.

## Projects and Contributions
These are the last projects I've been working on:
- [English Exercises Generator](https://github.com/ivanrdnv/exercise-generator): a Python application that generates English exercises based on uploaded texts.
- [Yandex Practicum](https://github.com/ivanrdnv/yandex-practicum) holds a collection of data science projects completed by me during the training course

## Extra 
Apart from data, I'm an avid autodidact and polymath. Computational linguistics, natural language processing, and cognitive neuroscience inspire me the most.
